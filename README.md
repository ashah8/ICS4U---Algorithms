# ICS4U---Algorithms
For algorithms.

What did you learn?
I learned that the trial and error method of solving the puzzle does not work. That plan quickly breaks down when you're under pressure of time.
What did you like?
The actual solving part of it was something that was fun.  
What could be better?
We should actually be able to hold the puzzle and view it when we get the spectating time. That way we don't have to stretch our head so far. It would be right in our hands. Another thing is that we might want to do a more complicated puzzle.  In addition, another thing that could be better is the preparation before we go into these situations where we have to solve a puzzle in the given time. Maybe it would be better if we could get an algorithm sheet?
